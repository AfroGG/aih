Question:
write a poem about moon, 5 lines please.

Answer:
A Distant Moon

A Distant Moon, so bright and full,
A sight to make a heart grow cool.

The light it sheds, so soft and warm,
A gentle glow across the storm.

A sight to make a heart grow still,
A Distant Moon, so bright and full.

Answer:
Here is a 5 line poem about the moon:

Ode to the Moon

Glowing orb in night sky, 
Your silver light from up high.
Guiding wanderers in darkness, 
As you wax and wane, sun's starkness.
Mysteries you still hold, 
In craters so cold.

The Moon is a silver ball
That hangs in the sky so tall.
It shines down on us all,
And makes the night seem not so small.

Silver beams cascade, through the velvet night,
Guiding hearts, with its gentle light.
